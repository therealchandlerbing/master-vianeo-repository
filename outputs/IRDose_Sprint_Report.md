| Overall Vianeo Score | Market Maturity Score | Status |
|---------------------|----------------------|--------|
| **4.1 / 5.0** | **3.1 / 5.0** | **CONDITIONAL PROCEED** |

### 1.2 Project Overview

The IRDose project represents a technically sophisticated venture developing a personalized radioiodine dosimetry system for hyperthyroidism treatment. Over four validation sessions spanning October through December 2025, 360 Social Impact Studios conducted a comprehensive Vianeo business model evaluation covering all five critical dimensions: Legitimacy, Desirability, Acceptability, Feasibility, and Viability.

The project demonstrates exceptional technical legitimacy with a validated clinical problem (20-29% treatment failure rates in current fixed-dose I-131 therapy), a functional TRL 4-5 laboratory prototype featuring GAGG+SiPM crystal spectrometry achieving 7-12% energy resolution, and a world-class team of 13+ doctorate-level researchers at IPEN/CNEN. Secured FAPESP PIPE funding of R$600,000, established partnerships at HC/FMUSP for clinical validation, and operational IRDose cloud platform with INPI intellectual property registration provide strong institutional backing.

However, the market maturity score of 3.1/5.0 falls below the 3.2 threshold for commercial readiness, driven primarily by critical gaps in customer validation and business model development rather than technical limitations. The project's path to commercial success requires immediate execution of a comprehensive customer discovery sprint before advancing to Series A fundraising.
