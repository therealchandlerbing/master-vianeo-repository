# Archive

This directory contains historical project management artifacts that are preserved for reference but excluded from active LLM context to optimize token usage.

## Contents

## Why Archived?

These files are valuable historical records but do not contribute to LLM reasoning during framework execution. Archiving them saves ~13,400 tokens of context space.

To restore any file to active documentation, move it back to `docs/`.
