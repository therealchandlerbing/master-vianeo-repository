### Critical Formatting Rules

1. **All 40 questions must be scored** - Use 1-5 or special codes (INSUFFICIENT DATA / N/A), never leave blank
2. **Evidence required for all numeric scores** - Each score of 1-5 must include specific evidence citation or gap description
3. **Dimension averages calculated correctly** - Formula: (sum of numeric scores) / (count of numeric scores), excluding INSUFFICIENT DATA and N/A
4. **Two-document output mandatory** - Assessment Results + Score Summary, both in .md and .docx (4 files total)
5. **Red flags must be checked when thresholds met** - Example: T9≤2 triggers "No full-time commitment" red flag
