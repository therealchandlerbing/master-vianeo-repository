# Step 0: Executive Brief Extraction

## Overview
This step transforms raw application materials into structured Executive Briefs. This is the foundational document that serves as input for all subsequent VIANEO framework steps.

## Purpose
Extract and structure key information from application documents into a standardized format for analysis.

## Core Sections

The Executive Brief contains seven core sections:

- **B1: Project Name** - Official project title and working name
- **B2: Problem Statement** - The core problem being addressed
- **B3: Proposed Solution** - The technical/business solution approach
- **B4: Target Market** - Market segments and target customers
- **B5: Business Model** - Revenue model and value proposition
- **B6: Traction** - Evidence of progress, validation, and achievements
- **B7: Team** - Key team members and their relevant expertise

## Additional Components

- **Maturity Stage Classification** - Assessment of project development stage
- **Quality Checklist** - Validation of information completeness and quality

## Deliverables

- **Markdown Format** - Structured text document (`.md`)
- **DOCX Format** - Word document for sharing and collaboration (`.docx`)

## Usage

This Executive Brief serves as the master document referenced by all subsequent diagnostic and analysis steps in the VIANEO framework.
