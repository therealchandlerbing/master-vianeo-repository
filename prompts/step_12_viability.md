# Step 12: Viability Assessment

## Overview
Comprehensive framework for transforming validated customer needs and technical capabilities into commercial structures, producing Product/Market Fit sheets, Business Model Canvases, and interactive viability dashboards.

## Purpose
Validate commercial sustainability by connecting validated needs (Steps 5-7) and confirmed capabilities (Step 11) into coherent business models with evidence-based product configurations.

## Instructions for AI Assistant

Transform validated needs (Steps 5-7) and confirmed capabilities (Step 11) into commercial structures. For each product, create a Product/Market Fit Sheet and Business Model Canvas. Ensure 100% coverage of fundamental needs with MVP features. Flag all unvalidated assumptions. Generate deliverables per the output format below.

## Assessment Framework

### Three Output Documents (Per Product)

#### 1. Product/Market Fit Sheet
- Product identity (name, description)
- Targeted requesters (2-4 personas from Step 6)
- Primary needs addressed (5-10 needs from Step 7)
- Product features (6-10 MVP + phased)
- Resource requirements and gaps
- Coverage validation matrix

#### 2. Business Model Canvas
- Value proposition (competitive advantages)
- Revenue stream (pricing, monetization)
- Distribution channel (discovery, purchase)
- Cost structure (development, operations, scaling)
- Coherence validation across components

#### 3. Summary Dashboard
- Portfolio overview (all products)
- Need coverage analysis
- Strategic insights (strengths, opportunities, concerns, recommendations)
- Launch sequencing and roadmap

## Core Philosophy

**Evidence-based configuration, not aspirational planning.**

Only include:
- ✅ Validated features (from Step 11)
- ✅ Validated clients (from Steps 5-7)
- ✅ Validated needs (from Step 7)
- ⚠️ Assumptions explicitly flagged

## Essential Inputs

### From Desirability Analysis (Steps 5-7)
- Validated client segments
- Requester personas with evidence
- Needs qualification matrices with intensity ratings
- Interview validation counts per need

### From Feasibility (Step 11)
- Feature library with timelines
- Feature-to-need mappings
- Available resources (means)
- Technical partnerships confirmed

### From Project Context
- Domain and problem statement
- Stage of development
- Organizational constraints

## Six-Phase Generation Process

### Phase 1: Setup & Scoping (15-20 min)
- Review all prior work (Steps 5-7, 11)
- Determine number of product configurations needed
- Identify gaps in input data
- Set quality expectations

### Phase 2: Product/Market Fit Definition (1-2 hours per product)
- Define product identity (name ≤60 chars, description ≤250 chars)
- Map targeted requesters and their needs
- Select MVP features (6-10 must-have items)
- Confirm resource requirements and gaps
- Write feature selection rationale

### Phase 3: Business Model Design (45-60 min per product)
- Define value proposition with competitive advantages
- Specify revenue stream and pricing (concrete examples required)
- Detail distribution channel (discovery + purchase process)
- Document cost structure (development, operations, scaling)
- Validate coherence across all four components

### Phase 4: Output Generation (30-45 min)
- Format PMF sheets using templates (markdown + DOCX)
- Format Business Model Canvases (markdown + DOCX)
- Verify character limits and completeness

### Phase 5: Summary Dashboard Creation (45-60 min)
- Portfolio overview with aggregate metrics
- Need coverage analysis matrix
- Strategic insights (4-6 cards)
- Launch sequencing recommendations

### Phase 6: Quality Validation (20-30 min)
- Completeness checks (all sections filled)
- Consistency checks (names, personas, features align)
- Clarity checks (client-understandable language)
- Evidence checks (citations to prior steps)
- Commercial sustainability (margins, CAC/LTV)

## Quality Standards

### Character Limits (Platform Integration)
- Product name: ≤60 characters
- Product description: ≤250 characters
- Value proposition summary: ≤250 characters
- Revenue stream summary: ≤250 characters
- Distribution channel summary: ≤250 characters
- Cost structure summary: ≤250 characters

### Feature Selection
- **MVP**: 6-10 features addressing fundamental needs
- **Phased**: 0-5 features for future releases
- **Validation**: >50% of MVP features with ≥5 interviews

### Business Model Coherence
All four components must align:
- Value justifies pricing
- Distribution reaches target requesters
- Revenue covers costs at scale
- No internal contradictions

## Timeline Expectations

**Single Product**: 3-4 hours total
**Two Products**: 5-6 hours total
**Three Products**: 7-9 hours total

## Output Deliverables

### Per Product
- Product/Market Fit Sheet (markdown + DOCX)
- Business Model Canvas (markdown + DOCX)

### Portfolio Level
- Summary Dashboard (markdown + interactive HTML)

## Output Format

**CRITICAL**: Follow the format specifications exactly for consistent, professional outputs.

**Template References**:
- `templates/Step12_PMF_Template.md` - Product/Market Fit structure
- `templates/Step12_Business_Model_Template.md` - Business Model Canvas structure
- `templates/Step12_Dashboard_Template.md` - Summary Dashboard markdown
- `templates/Step12_Viability_Dashboard.html` - Interactive HTML dashboard

Before delivering output:
1. Generate content following the methodology in this prompt
2. Format output according to the templates
3. Run quality validation checks (Phase 6)
4. Only deliver if all validation checks pass

### Critical Formatting Rules

1. **Character limits strictly enforced** - Product descriptions ≤250 chars, all platform summaries ≤250 chars
2. **MVP feature count: 6-10 items** - No fewer than 6, no more than 12, each must map to validated need
3. **All fundamental needs covered** - 100% coverage required, gaps must be explicitly justified
4. **Pricing must be specific** - NOT "TBD" or "competitive pricing" but actual price points with validation status
5. **Business model coherence validated** - All four components (value, revenue, distribution, cost) must align without contradictions

### Validation Requirements

**Product/Market Fit Sheet**:
- All requesters from Step 6 personas
- All needs from Step 7 qualification matrix
- All features from Step 11 feature library
- Resource requirements match Step 11 feasibility
- Coverage validation: All fundamental needs have MVP features

**Business Model Canvas**:
- Value advantages cite validation (Steps 5-9)
- Pricing validated or flagged as assumption
- Distribution channels confirmed feasible
- Cost estimates based on research
- Coherence checks: No red flags (premium pricing + low LTV, etc.)

**Summary Dashboard**:
- Portfolio metrics calculated correctly
- Need coverage percentages accurate
- Strategic insights evidence-based
- Launch sequencing justified by validation strength
