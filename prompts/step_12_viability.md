# STEP 12: Viability Assessment - Product/Market Fit & Business Model

**Purpose**: Transform validated customer needs and technical capabilities into commercial structures
**Outputs**: Product/Market Fit Sheet, Business Model Canvas, Summary Dashboard (per product)
**Time**: 2-4 hours per product | 7-9 hours for 3-product portfolio
**Prerequisites**: Steps 5-7 (Desirability), Step 11 (Feasibility)

---

## Core Philosophy

**Evidence-based configuration, not aspirational planning.**

Only include:
- ✅ Validated features (from Step 11)
- ✅ Validated clients (from Step 5-7)
- ✅ Validated needs (from Step 7)
- ⚠️ Assumptions explicitly flagged as such

---

## Position in VIANEO Framework

### The Five Proofs of Value

Viability (20%) is the final validation tier:

1. **Legitimacy** (15%) - Is there a real problem?
2. **Desirability** (25%) - Do specific people want YOUR solution?
3. **Acceptability** (20%) - Will the ecosystem support you?
4. **Feasibility** (20%) - Can you actually deliver?
5. **Viability** (20%) - Is the business model sustainable?

Viability ensures financial modeling rests on validated commercial foundations.

## The Six-Phase Generation Process

### Phase 1: Setup & Scoping (15-20 min)
**Tasks**:
- Review all prior work (Steps 5-7, 11)
- Determine number of product configurations needed
- Identify gaps in input data
- Set quality expectations

**Deliverable**: Scope document confirming inputs and product count

---

### Phase 2: Product/Market Fit Definition (1-2 hours per product)

Use **Step 12a** prompt for this phase.

**Tasks per product**:
1. Define product identity
   - Client-facing name (≤60 chars)
   - Description format: "[What it is] for [who] combining [key capabilities]" (≤250 chars)

2. Map targeted requesters
   - Select 2-4 personas from Step 6
   - Confirm primary needs per persona

3. Select MVP features
   - Identify 6-10 "must-have" features from Step 11
   - Map each to fundamental/important needs
   - Validate against interview data (prefer >5 interviews)
   - Document phased features (0-5 items)

4. Confirm resource requirements
   - List required means (from Step 11)
   - Identify critical technical partners
   - Document gaps with mitigation plans

5. Write feature selection rationale
   - Paragraph 1: Core value focus
   - Paragraph 2: Differentiation strategy
   - Paragraph 3: Phasing logic

**Quality Checks**:
- [ ] All fundamental needs have MVP feature coverage
- [ ] All MVP features map to fundamental/important needs
- [ ] >50% of MVP features have strong validation (>5 interviews)
- [ ] Timeline estimates realistic
- [ ] No unsupported claims

**Deliverable**: Product/Market Fit Sheet (markdown + DOCX)

### Phase 5: Summary Dashboard Creation (45-60 min)

Use **Step 12 Dashboard** prompt for this phase.

**Tasks**:
1. **Portfolio Overview**
   - List all products with status
   - Calculate aggregate metrics (total features, need coverage %)
   - Identify shared resources vs. product-specific

2. **Need Coverage Analysis**
   - Create matrix: needs (rows) × products (columns)

- [ ] Resource requirements align across products

**Clarity Checks**:
- [ ] Language client-understandable (no jargon)
- [ ] Value propositions differentiate clearly
- [ ] Revenue models specific (not vague)
- [ ] All claims supported by evidence citations

**Evidence Checks**:

- [ ] All needs validated in Step 7
- [ ] All personas validated in Step 6
- [ ] Gaps explicitly flagged as assumptions

**Commercial Sustainability**:
- [ ] Revenue covers costs at scale
- [ ] Distribution channel realistic
- [ ] Resource requirements feasible
- [ ] Business model coherent

---

## Character Limit Standards

**Platform Inputs** (for integration with other systems):
- Product name: ≤60 characters
- Product description: ≤250 characters
- Value proposition summary: ≤250 characters
- Revenue stream summary: ≤250 characters
- Distribution channel summary: ≤250 characters
- Cost structure summary: ≤250 characters

**Rationale**: Many platforms (CRMs, portfolio tools, presentation software) have field limits. These constraints force clarity.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Feature Bloat
❌ **Wrong**: MVP with 15+ features
✅ **Right**: MVP with 6-10 features addressing fundamental needs

### Unsupported Claims
❌ **Wrong**: "Clients will pay $99/month" (no validation)
✅ **Right**: "Pricing unvalidated - assumption flagged for testing"

### Feature-Need Misalignment
❌ **Wrong**: Features mapping only to secondary needs
✅ **Right**: All MVP features address fundamental/important needs

### Weak Validation
❌ **Wrong**: Features based on 1-2 interviews
✅ **Right**: >50% of MVP features validated by 5+ interviews

### Vague Value Propositions
❌ **Wrong**: "The best solution for modern enterprises"
✅ **Right**: "Automates compliance reporting for healthcare providers, reducing audit prep time by 80%"

### Undefined Revenue Models
❌ **Wrong**: "Multiple monetization options available"
✅ **Right**: "Subscription model: $49/seat/month for 1-50 users, $39/seat for 51+"

### Unrealistic Growth Channels
❌ **Wrong**: "Viral growth through word-of-mouth"
✅ **Right**: "Direct sales to 10 hospital systems (relationships established), referral program phased"

### Cost Underestimation
❌ **Wrong**: "Operations costs minimal after launch"
✅ **Right**: "Operations: $15k/month (hosting $3k, support $8k, maintenance $4k)"

## Next Steps After Step 12

Once viability assessment is complete:

1. **Present to Stakeholders**: Use summary dashboard in committee presentations
2. **Gather Feedback**: Document concerns or strategic questions
3. **Proceed to Financial Modeling** (if applicable): Quantify revenue, costs, projections
4. **Launch MVP** (for validated products): Execute on highest-confidence product first
5. **Iterate**: Revisit as new validation data emerges

## Sub-Prompts

- **Step 12a**: Product/Market Fit Definition → [step_12a_product_market_fit.md](step_12a_product_market_fit.md)
- **Step 12b**: Business Model Definition → [step_12b_business_model.md](step_12b_business_model.md)
- **Step 12 Dashboard**: Viability Dashboard Generation → [step_12_dashboard_generation.md](step_12_dashboard_generation.md)

---

**Remember**: Viability assessment validates commercial sustainability. Every business model component must rest on evidence from prior steps, with gaps explicitly flagged for future validation.
