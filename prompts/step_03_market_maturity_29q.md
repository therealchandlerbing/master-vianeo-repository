2. **Desirability threshold is 3.5** - NOT 3.0 like other dimensions (highest threshold in framework)
3. **Overall score uses exact weights** - Legitimacy 0.15, Desirability 0.25, Acceptability 0.20, Feasibility 0.20, Viability 0.20
4. **Status indicators use symbols** - Must use ✓ PASS or ✗ FAIL (not text like "Pass" or "Fail")
5. **Evidence gaps use "Need:" prefix** - Format: "Need: [specific action]" when evidence is missing (be specific, not vague)
