# STEP 12b: Business Model Definition

**Purpose**: Design coherent business models across four integrated dimensions
**Output**: Business Model Canvas (Markdown + DOCX)
**Time**: 45-60 minutes per product
**Part of**: Step 12 Viability Assessment

---

## When to Use This Prompt

Use after completing:
- ✅ Step 12a: Product/Market Fit definition for this product
- ✅ Steps 5-7: Desirability analysis (validated needs, personas)
- ✅ Step 8-9: Acceptability analysis (ecosystem, players, influencers)
- ✅ Step 11: Feasibility analysis (features, resources, partnerships)

---

## Business Model Canvas Framework

A business model has **four integrated components**:

1. **Value Proposition** - Why clients choose this over alternatives
2. **Revenue Stream** - How income is generated
3. **Distribution Channel** - How clients discover and purchase
4. **Cost Structure** - Expenses required for delivery

**Critical**: All four must align. Contradictions = incoherent model = commercial failure.

---

## 1. Value Proposition

### Core Positioning Statement

**Format**: One sentence combining who + what + key benefit

**Template**: "[Product] helps [target requesters] [achieve outcome] by [differentiation]"

**Example**:
```
HealthCare Compliance Hub helps hospital compliance officers reduce audit preparation time by 80% through pre-built regulatory templates and automated checklists.
```

**Guidelines**:
- Use client language (not internal jargon)
- Specify measurable outcome (80% reduction, not "saves time")
- Highlight differentiation (pre-built templates vs. generic tools)
- Tie to validated needs from Step 7

---

### Competitive Advantages (2-4 items)

List specific advantages supported by evidence from prior steps:

**Each advantage must include**:
- **Advantage**: What makes you different
- **Evidence**: Citation to validation (Step 5-9)
- **Impact**: Why this matters to clients

**Example**:
```
1. Pre-Built Framework Templates
   - Evidence: Partnership with 3 regulatory consulting firms (Step 9), 15 frameworks pre-configured
   - Impact: Deploys in 2 weeks vs. 2-3 months for competitors (validated in 7/8 interviews)

2. Automated Audit Trail
   - Evidence: Technical feasibility confirmed (Step 11), addresses fundamental need (4.8/5 intensity)
   - Impact: Reduces audit prep from 40 hours to 8 hours (validated in 8/8 interviews)
```

**Quality Check**: Each advantage must tie to:
- Validated need from Step 7 (desirability)
- Confirmed capability from Step 11 (feasibility)
- Ecosystem support from Step 8-9 (acceptability)

---

### Client Benefits by Requester Type

For each persona from Step 12a, specify benefits:

**Persona**: [Name from Step 6]
**Primary Benefit**: [Measurable outcome]
**Secondary Benefits**: [2-3 additional outcomes]

**Example**:
```
**Sarah (Compliance Director - Large Hospital)**
- Primary: Reduce audit prep time from 40 hours to 8 hours
- Secondary: Automated regulatory updates, staff training integration, audit trail documentation

**Mike (Clinic Administrator - Small Practice)**
- Primary: Simplify compliance tracking (no specialist required)
- Secondary: 2-week deployment (vs. 3-month setup), affordable pricing ($49/month vs. $500/month)
```

---

### Platform Summary (≤250 characters)

Compress value proposition into 250-character summary for platform inputs:

**Format**: [What] for [who]: [key benefits 1, 2, 3]

**Example**:
```
Compliance automation for healthcare providers: pre-built regulatory templates, 80% faster audit prep, 2-week deployment. Serves hospitals and clinics with automated checklists and regulatory tracking. (227 chars ✓)
```

**Character count validation**: Must be ≤250 chars.

---

## 2. Revenue Stream

### Monetization Mechanism

**Specify**:
- Revenue model type (subscription, commission, license, transaction, freemium, etc.)
- Why this model fits (tie to client behavior and validated needs)

**Example**:
```
**Model**: Subscription (recurring monthly)
**Rationale**: Compliance is ongoing (not one-time), validated in 8/8 interviews. Clients prefer predictable monthly costs over large upfront fees. Recurring model aligns with continuous regulatory updates.
```

---

### Pricing Approach with Concrete Examples

**Do not write**: "Competitive pricing" or "TBD"
**Do write**: Specific pricing with tiers, examples, rationale

**Include**:
- Pricing tiers (if applicable)
- Specific price points
- Value metric (per user, per facility, per transaction, etc.)
- Validation status (validated, assumption, flagged for testing)

**Example**:
```
**Pricing Structure**:
- Small Practices (1-10 users): $49/user/month
- Mid-Size Facilities (11-50 users): $39/user/month
- Large Hospitals (51+ users): Custom pricing (starts at $29/user/month)

**Value Metric**: Per-user pricing (each compliance officer gets access)

**Validation Status**: ⚠️ Assumption (pricing not validated in interviews)
- Next step: Willingness-to-pay survey with 10 prospects
- Hypothesis: $49/month justified by 40-hour time savings ($2k+ value per month at $50/hour rate)
```

**Critical**: Flag unvalidated pricing as assumption. Never present assumptions as facts.

---

### Revenue Dependencies & Constraints

**Document**:
- Payment timing (monthly, annual, usage-based)
- Minimum commitments (contracts, seats, etc.)
- Churn assumptions (based on industry benchmarks or validation)
- Payment constraints (procurement cycles, budget approval processes)

**Example**:
```
**Payment Timing**: Monthly (credit card) or Annual (20% discount for upfront payment)
**Minimum**: 1-user minimum, no long-term contracts
**Churn Assumptions**:
- Target: <10% monthly churn (industry benchmark for B2B SaaS: 5-10%)
- Risk: Compliance software often locked in once integrated (positive lock-in effect)
**Constraints**:
- Hospital procurement cycles: 3-6 months (enterprise sales)
- Clinic decision-making: 2-4 weeks (SMB sales)
```

---

### Platform Summary (≤250 characters)

**Example**:
```
Subscription: $49/user/month (small practices), $39/user/month (mid-size), custom pricing (large hospitals). Monthly or annual billing. No long-term contracts. Targets <10% monthly churn. (209 chars ✓)
```

---

## 3. Distribution Channel

### Discovery/Awareness Channels

**How will clients find you?**

**Categories**:
- **Digital**: SEO, content marketing, paid ads, social media
- **Traditional**: Trade shows, industry publications, direct mail
- **Referral**: Partner referrals, customer referrals, influencer recommendations
- **Direct**: Outbound sales, cold outreach, email campaigns
- **Organic**: Word-of-mouth, press coverage, thought leadership

**Specify 2-4 primary channels with rationale**:

**Example**:
```
**Primary Channels**:
1. **Partner Referrals** (from regulatory consulting firms)
   - Rationale: 3 consulting firm partnerships established (Step 9)
   - Reach: ~500 hospital clients across partner networks
   - Evidence: Partners confirmed willingness to recommend (documented in Step 9)

2. **Healthcare Compliance Conferences** (trade shows)
   - Rationale: Target persona (Sarah) attends 2-3 conferences/year (validated in Step 6)
   - Reach: 2,000+ compliance officers per event
   - Cost: $15k per conference (booth + travel)

3. **SEO + Content Marketing** (healthcare compliance blog)
   - Rationale: 70% of prospects research online before purchase (industry benchmark)
   - Timeline: 6-12 months to build organic traffic
   - Cost: $3k/month (content writer + SEO)
```

---

### Purchase/Transaction Channel

**How do clients buy?**

**Categories**:
- **Self-Service**: Online signup, credit card payment
- **Sales-Assisted**: Demo → proposal → contract
- **Enterprise Sales**: RFP process, procurement, legal review
- **Marketplace**: Third-party platform (app store, marketplace)
- **Reseller**: Through partners or distributors

**Specify purchase process**:

**Example**:
```
**Purchase Process**:
- **Small Practices**: Self-service signup (online, credit card, immediate access)
- **Mid-Size Facilities**: Sales-assisted (30-min demo → 14-day trial → contract)
- **Large Hospitals**: Enterprise sales (RFP response → 90-day trial → procurement → legal → contract)

**Sales Cycle**:
- Small: 1-2 weeks (trial to paid)
- Mid-Size: 4-8 weeks (demo to contract)
- Large: 3-6 months (RFP to contract)
```

---

### Intermediary Strategy

**Direct vs. Reseller?**

**Direct**:
- You sell directly to end clients
- Higher margins, full control, more resources required

**Reseller/Channel Partners**:
- Partners sell on your behalf (commission or markup)
- Lower margins, faster scale, less control

**Hybrid**:
- Direct for enterprise, partners for SMB
- Or geographic split (direct in US, partners internationally)

**Example**:
```
**Strategy**: Hybrid
- **Direct Sales**: Large hospitals (enterprise accounts, complex sales, high LTV justifies direct investment)
- **Partner Referrals**: Small-mid practices (consulting firms refer clients, we pay 15% referral fee)

**Rationale**:
- Large hospitals require custom procurement support (direct control needed)
- Small practices trust consulting firm recommendations (partners accelerate trust-building)
```

---

### Geographic Considerations

If applicable:
- Initial launch geography (US-only, specific regions)
- Expansion phases (domestic → international)
- Localization requirements (language, regulations, partnerships)

**Example**:
```
**Launch**: US-only (healthcare regulations are US-specific)
**Phase 2**: Canada (similar regulatory framework, 12-month post-launch)
**Not Planned**: Europe (requires GDPR + different regulatory frameworks, 24+ month timeline)
```

---

### Platform Summary (≤250 characters)

**Example**:
```
Discovery: Partner referrals (3 consulting firms), compliance conferences, SEO. Purchase: Self-service (SMB), sales-assisted (mid-size), enterprise sales (hospitals). Direct + partner hybrid. US-only launch. (238 chars ✓)
```

---

## 4. Cost Structure

### Development Costs

**One-time costs** to build and launch:

**Example**:
```
**Development**: $180k
- 3 backend engineers × 6 months × $30k = $90k
- 2 frontend engineers × 6 months × $25k = $75k
- UX designer × 3 months × $15k = $15k

**Security/Compliance**: $50k
- HIPAA compliance audit: $25k
- Security certifications: $15k
- Legal review (privacy policies, contracts): $10k

**Content Development**: $30k
- 15 regulatory framework templates (consulting firm partnership, content validation)

**Total Development**: $260k
```

---

### Operations/Production Costs

**Ongoing monthly/annual costs**:

**Example**:
```
**Infrastructure** (monthly):
- AWS hosting: $2k/month
- HIPAA-compliant storage: $1k/month
- Monitoring/security tools: $500/month
- **Subtotal**: $3.5k/month = $42k/year

**Support**:
- Customer support (2 FTE): $8k/month = $96k/year
- Technical maintenance: $4k/month = $48k/year
- **Subtotal**: $144k/year

**Content Updates**:
- Regulatory change tracking (consulting firm contract): $2k/month = $24k/year

**Total Operations**: $210k/year
```

---

### Marketing & Sales Costs

**Example**:
```
**Marketing**:
- Content marketing (SEO, blog): $3k/month = $36k/year
- Paid ads (Google, LinkedIn): $5k/month = $60k/year
- Conferences (3 per year): $45k/year
- **Subtotal**: $141k/year

**Sales**:
- 2 sales reps (mid-size + enterprise): $180k/year (base + commission)
- Sales tools (CRM, outreach): $12k/year
- **Subtotal**: $192k/year

**Total Marketing & Sales**: $333k/year
```

---

### Human Resources & G&A

**Example**:
```
**Team** (post-launch):
- 2 engineers (maintenance, features): $180k/year
- 1 product manager: $120k/year
- 2 support staff: $96k/year
- 2 sales reps: $180k/year
- **Subtotal**: $576k/year

**G&A**:
- Office/admin: $24k/year
- Insurance, legal, accounting: $36k/year
- **Subtotal**: $60k/year

**Total HR & G&A**: $636k/year
```

---

### Fixed vs. Variable Classification

**Fixed Costs** (don't scale with customers):
- Core team salaries
- Office/admin
- Base infrastructure

**Variable Costs** (scale with customers):
- Hosting (per user)
- Support (scales with customer count)
- Sales commissions (per deal)

**Example**:
```
**Fixed**: $600k/year (core team, office, base infrastructure)
**Variable**: ~$50/customer/year (hosting, support, sales commission)

**Break-Even**: Need ~12,000 customers at $49/month to cover fixed + variable costs
- Revenue: 12,000 × $49 × 12 = $7.06M/year
- Fixed: $600k
- Variable: 12,000 × $50 = $600k
- Total Costs: $1.2M/year
```

---

### Cost Drivers & Scaling

**What drives costs as you scale?**

**Example**:
```
**Primary Cost Driver**: Support and sales headcount
- Ratio: 1 support rep per 500 customers
- Ratio: 1 sales rep per $1M ARR

**Scaling Economics**:
- At 1,000 customers: $1.2M costs / $588k revenue = **Not profitable**
- At 5,000 customers: $1.45M costs / $2.94M revenue = **50% margin**
- At 10,000 customers: $1.7M costs / $5.88M revenue = **71% margin**

**Margin improves with scale** due to fixed cost leverage.
```

---

### Platform Summary (≤250 characters)

**Example**:
```
Dev: $260k one-time. Operations: $210k/year. Marketing/Sales: $333k/year. HR/G&A: $636k/year. Fixed: $600k, variable: $50/customer. Break-even: ~12k customers. Margins improve with scale (50% at 5k, 71% at 10k). (249 chars ✓)
```

---

## 5. Coherence Validation

### Alignment Checks

**Test for contradictions** across all four components:

| Dimension Pair | Alignment Question | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Value ↔ Revenue | Does pricing match perceived value? | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ |
| Value ↔ Distribution | Do channels reach target requesters? | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ |
| Revenue ↔ Distribution | Can channel support revenue model? | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ |
| Revenue ↔ Costs | Do margins cover costs at scale? | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ |
| Distribution ↔ Costs | Are CAC economics sustainable? | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ |

**Example**:
```
| Value ↔ Revenue | $49/month justified by $2k+ time savings | ✅ Aligned |
| Value ↔ Distribution | Partners reach compliance officers | ✅ Aligned |
| Revenue ↔ Distribution | Self-service supports low-touch sales | ✅ Aligned |
| Revenue ↔ Costs | 71% margins at 10k customers | ✅ Aligned |
| Distribution ↔ Costs | CAC $500, LTV $3,528 (LTV:CAC = 7:1) | ✅ Aligned |
```

---

### Common Red Flags

**Watch for these contradictions**:

❌ **Premium positioning + budget pricing**
- Value: "Best-in-class enterprise platform"
- Revenue: "$9.99/month"
- **Issue**: Price signals low value, contradicts positioning

❌ **High-touch sales + low LTV**
- Distribution: "Enterprise sales team, 6-month sales cycle"
- Revenue: "$500/year contract"
- **Issue**: Sales cost ($10k CAC) exceeds LTV

❌ **Viral growth + niche segment**
- Distribution: "Word-of-mouth, viral sharing"
- Value: "For healthcare compliance officers managing 15+ frameworks"
- **Issue**: Audience too narrow for viral mechanics

❌ **Self-service + complex product**
- Distribution: "Online signup, no sales support"
- Value: "Enterprise platform requiring 3-month implementation"
- **Issue**: Buyers need hand-holding, self-service will fail

❌ **Low margins + high CAC**
- Revenue: "$300/year, 20% margin = $60/customer"
- Distribution: "Paid ads, $200 CAC"
- **Issue**: Never recover acquisition cost

---

### Overall Business Model Assessment

**Coherence Rating**:
- ✅ **Coherent**: All components aligned, no contradictions, sustainable economics
- ⚠️ **Partially Coherent**: Minor misalignments, flagged for refinement
- ❌ **Incoherent**: Major contradictions, requires redesign

**Example**:
```
**Assessment**: ✅ Coherent

**Rationale**:
- Value proposition (80% time savings) justifies pricing ($49/month << $2k savings)
- Distribution (partner referrals + conferences) reaches target persona (compliance officers)
- Revenue model (subscription) supports self-service + sales-assisted channels
- Cost structure (71% margins at scale) sustainable with $500 CAC and $3,528 LTV
- No major contradictions identified
```

## Next Steps

After completing Business Model Canvas:

1. **If defining multiple products**: Repeat Step 12b for each product
2. **Proceed to Step 12 Dashboard**: Compile all PMF sheets + Business Models into portfolio summary
3. **Review coherence across portfolio**: Ensure products are complementary (not competing)
4. **Validate with stakeholders**: Confirm business models align with strategic goals and resource availability

---

**Remember**: A coherent business model has all four components aligned. Value justifies pricing, distribution reaches customers, costs sustainable at scale. Every component must rest on evidence, with assumptions explicitly flagged.
