# Step 5: Needs & Requesters

## Overview
This step applies the WHO/WHAT/WHY/HOW framework to assess desirability and validate user needs.

## Purpose
Systematically identify and validate the needs of target users and stakeholders to ensure the solution addresses real, valuable problems.

## Framework Components

### WHO - Target Users
- User identification
- Segmentation
- Prioritization
- Personas

### WHAT - Needs Definition
- Explicit needs
- Latent needs
- Job to be done
- Pain points

### WHY - Underlying Motivations
- Core drivers
- Value expectations
- Decision criteria
- Success metrics

### HOW - Current Solutions
- Existing alternatives
- Workarounds
- Competitive solutions
- Gaps in current offerings

## Desirability Assessment
- Need intensity
- Market size
- Willingness to pay
- Switching costs

## Output
- Validated needs list
- User priorities
- Desirability score
- Design implications

## Output Format

**CRITICAL**: Follow the format specification exactly for consistent, professional outputs.

**Format Reference**: `docs/FORMAT_SPEC_Step5_Needs_Requesters.md`

Before delivering output:
1. Generate content following the methodology in this prompt
2. Format output according to the format specification
3. Run the validation checklist from the format spec
4. Only deliver if all validation checks pass

### Critical Formatting Rules

1. **Every need statement must be ≤60 characters** - Strictly enforced, no exceptions (use character counter)
2. **Requesters table: 6-10 distinct types** - No fewer than 6, no more than 10, each must be truly distinct
3. **Reliability ratings use exact prescribed phrases** - "More than 5 interviewed" / "Less than 5 interviewed [validate with interviews]" / "Not yet interviewed [validate with interviews]" / "Unspecified [validate with interviews]"
4. **No embedded solutions in need statements** - NOT "Need mobile app to..." but "Track cognitive performance objectively"
5. **Four-file output package required** - 1 Markdown + 3 DOCX files (Core Analysis, Strategic Analysis, Interview Guide)

See the complete format specification for:
- Requesters table structure (3 columns with specifications)
- Needs analysis categories (Tasks/Pains/Expectations with 60-char limit)
- Existing solutions table (5-6 solutions with "Doing Nothing" mandatory)
- Validation priority system (High/Medium/Low)
- Validation checklist (47 items)
- Common mistakes to avoid (13 items)
- File naming conventions (4-file package)
