# Step 11: Features-Needs Matrix

## Overview
Comprehensive framework for mapping product/service features to validated user needs and generating prioritized development roadmaps.

## Purpose
Create a systematic connection between identified user needs and proposed solution features to ensure product-market fit.

## Matrix Structure

### Features Inventory
*Template to be added for:*
- Feature ID and name
- Feature description
- Technical complexity
- Development effort
- Dependencies

### Needs Mapping
*Framework to be added for:*
- Need ID (from Step 7)
- Feature-need relationships
- Strength of connection
- Coverage assessment

### Scoring Dimensions
*To be populated with:*
- Need importance (from Needs Qualification Matrix)
- Feature impact on need
- Development cost
- Time to market
- Strategic value
- Competitive differentiation

## Analysis Components

### Coverage Analysis
- Which needs are well-addressed
- Which needs have gaps
- Over-engineered features
- Missing features

### Prioritization Framework
- Must-have features
- Should-have features
- Nice-to-have features
- Future considerations

### Roadmap Generation
- Phase 1: MVP features
- Phase 2: Growth features
- Phase 3: Scale features
- Feature sequencing logic

## Output Deliverables

### Features-Needs Matrix
- Visual matrix representation
- Scoring tables
- Gap analysis

### Development Roadmap
- Phased feature releases
- Timeline estimates
- Resource allocation
- Dependencies and risks

### Strategic Recommendations
- Product strategy alignment
- Market entry approach
- Differentiation strategy
- Build vs. partner decisions
