# Step 11: Features-Needs Matrix

## Overview
Comprehensive framework for mapping product/service features to validated user needs and generating prioritized development roadmaps.

## Purpose
Create a systematic connection between identified user needs and proposed solution features to ensure product-market fit.

## Matrix Structure

### Features Inventory
*Template to be added for:*
- Feature ID and name
- Feature description
- Technical complexity
- Development effort
- Dependencies

### Needs Mapping
*Framework to be added for:*
- Need ID (from Step 7)
- Feature-need relationships
- Strength of connection
- Coverage assessment

### Scoring Dimensions
*To be populated with:*
- Need importance (from Needs Qualification Matrix)
- Feature impact on need
- Development cost
- Time to market
- Strategic value
- Competitive differentiation

## Analysis Components

### Coverage Analysis
- Which needs are well-addressed
- Which needs have gaps
- Over-engineered features
- Missing features

### Prioritization Framework
- Must-have features
- Should-have features
- Nice-to-have features
- Future considerations

### Roadmap Generation
- Phase 1: MVP features
- Phase 2: Growth features
- Phase 3: Scale features
- Feature sequencing logic

## Output Deliverables

### Features-Needs Matrix
- Visual matrix representation
- Scoring tables
- Gap analysis

### Development Roadmap
- Phased feature releases
- Timeline estimates
- Resource allocation
- Dependencies and risks

### Strategic Recommendations
- Product strategy alignment
- Market entry approach
- Differentiation strategy
- Build vs. partner decisions

## Output Format

**CRITICAL**: Follow the format specification exactly for consistent, professional outputs.

**Format Reference**: `docs/FORMAT_SPEC_Step11_Features_Needs_Matrix.md`

Before delivering output:
1. Generate content following the methodology in this prompt
2. Format output according to the format specification
3. Run the validation checklist from the format spec
4. Only deliver if all validation checks pass

### Critical Formatting Rules

1. **Two-file output required** - Interactive HTML matrix (.html) + Strategic Analysis markdown (.md), both must be delivered
2. **Conservative checkmark marking** - Only mark where feature DIRECTLY addresses need (defensible connections only, no optimistic marking)
3. **All 10 needs from Step 7 included** - Exact opportunity classifications must match Step 7, no reclassification
4. **Export (Ctrl+E) and Print (Ctrl+P) functional** - CSV export and print optimization must work without errors
5. **Coverage targets enforced** - High Opportunity 100%, Expected 100%, overall 40-80% (outside range requires explanation)

See the complete format specification for:
- Interactive HTML specifications (sticky headers, color coding, SVG icons)
- Strategic Analysis document structure (9 required sections)
- Coverage metrics calculations (overall, by level, feature efficiency)
- Opportunity level definitions (High/Medium/Low/Expected/Accessory)
- Validation checklist (40+ items)
- Common mistakes to avoid (17 items)
- File naming conventions (dual output)
