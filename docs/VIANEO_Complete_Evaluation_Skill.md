# VIANEO Complete Business Model Evaluation System

> **Version**: 2.0 | **Last Updated**: November 2025

The VIANEO methodology is a **comprehensive 13-step business model evaluation system (Steps 0-12)** that assesses startups across five interconnected dimensions: Legitimacy (15%), Desirability (25%), Acceptability (20%), Feasibility (20%), and Viability (20%).

## Three Execution Paths

| Path | Steps | Time | Use Case |
|------|-------|------|----------|
| **Fast Track** | 0 → 2 → 3 | 90-135 min | Initial screening of multiple applications |
| **Standard** | 0 → 2 → 3 → 4-9 (selective) → 10 | 4-5 hours | Finalists requiring committee-ready evaluation |
| **Complete** | All 13 steps (0-12) | 6-8 hours | Major investments and executive presentations |

## The 13 Steps

### Phase 1: Foundation & Screening (Steps 0-3)
| Step | Name | Time | Output |
|------|------|------|--------|
| 0 | Executive Brief Extraction | 20-30m | Structured 7-section brief |
| 1 | Application Forms (Optional) | 15-20m | Program-specific docs |
| 2 | 40Q Diagnostic | 30-45m | 4-dimension assessment |
| 3 | 29Q Market Maturity | 45-60m | 5-dimension VIANEO scores |

### Phase 2: Deep Dive Validation (Steps 4-9)
| Step | Name | Time | Output |
|------|------|------|--------|
| 4 | Legitimacy Worksheet | 30-40m | Problem/solution validation |
| 5 | Needs/Requesters | 45-60m | WHO/WHAT/WHY/HOW analysis |
| 6 | Persona Development | 30-45m | Evidence-based personas |
| 7 | Needs Qualification Matrix | 45-90m | Interactive matrix + report |
| 8 | Players/Influencers | 30-40m | Ecosystem acceptability |
| 9 | Value Network Map | 45-60m | Network visualization |

### Phase 3: Synthesis & Decision (Steps 10-12)
| Step | Name | Time | Output |
|------|------|------|--------|
| 10 | Diagnostic Comment | 25-35m | Executive decision brief |
| 11 | Features-Needs Matrix | 30-45m | MVP scope analysis |
| 12 | Viability Assessment | 2-4h | PMF sheets, business models, dashboard |

## The 5 VIANEO Dimensions

| Dimension | Weight | Threshold | Key Question |
|-----------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **Legitimacy** | 15% | ≥3.0 | Is there a real problem worth solving? |
| **Desirability** | 25% | **≥3.5** | Do specific people want YOUR solution? (HIGHEST BAR) |
| **Acceptability** | 20% | ≥3.0 | Will the ecosystem support you? |
| **Feasibility** | 20% | ≥3.0 | Can you actually deliver? |
| **Viability** | 20% | ≥3.0 | Is the business model sustainable? |

**Decision Threshold**: Overall score ≥3.2 (weighted average) AND all individual thresholds met.

## Scoring Standards

Scores range 1-5, with evidence requirements:

| Score | Label | Evidence Required |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | Very Weak | Little to no evidence |
| 2 | Weak | Internal statements only (L1) |
| 3 | Adequate | Some external validation (L2) |
| 4 | Good | Strong external evidence (L3) |
| 5 | Excellent | Multiple validated sources (L3+) |

**Key Rule**: Only L3 (externally validated) evidence supports scores ≥4. Lower scores rely on internal validation only.

## Critical Outputs

Each evaluation produces:
- **Dimensional scores** with evidence-based justifications
- **Visual matrices** (HTML) for needs qualification and features-needs mapping
- **Ecosystem mappings** showing players, influencers, and value flows
- **Priority target identification** for sales and partnership focus
- **GO/MAYBE/NO recommendation** with supporting rationale

## Core Principle

> "Organizations don't have needs—people do."

The system requires identification of **specific requesters** within favorable organizations facing urgent problems. Generic market descriptions are insufficient; validated individual pain points are required.

## Implementation

1. **Select path** based on evaluation depth required
2. **Gather materials** (pitch deck, interviews, research)
3. **Execute sequentially** through numbered steps
4. **Generate outputs** using standardized templates
5. **Review and validate** with human oversight

All outputs are designed for committee review, investor due diligence, and executive decision-making.
