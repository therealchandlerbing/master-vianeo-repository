# VIANEO Complete Business Model Evaluation System - Summary

The VIANEO methodology is "a comprehensive 9-step business model evaluation system" that assesses startups across five interconnected dimensions: Legitimacy (15%), Desirability (25%), Acceptability (20%), Feasibility (20%), and Viability (20%).

## Three Execution Paths

**Fast Track (90 minutes):** Steps 0→2→4→5 for initial screening of multiple applications.

**Standard (4-5 hours):** Steps 0→2→3→4→5→6→7→8 for finalists requiring committee-ready evaluation.

**Complete (6-7 hours):** All steps 0-9 for major investments and executive presentations.

## Key Dimensions

The framework evaluates whether the problem is real (Legitimacy), customers want it (Desirability), the ecosystem supports it (Acceptability), the team can deliver it (Feasibility), and the business model works (Viability).

## Scoring Standards

Scores range 1-5, with threshold requirements: Legitimacy ≥3.0, Desirability ≥3.5 (highest bar), and others ≥3.0. "Only L3 (external validated) evidence supports scores ≥3," with lower categories relying on internal validation only.

## Critical Outputs

Each evaluation produces dimensional scores, visual matrices (HTML), ecosystem mappings, and priority target identification. The system emphasizes "Organizations don't have needs—people do," requiring identification of specific requesters within favorable organizations facing urgent problems.

## Implementation

Users select their path, gather materials, and execute sequentially through numbered steps, each producing standardized outputs suitable for committee review or investor due diligence.
