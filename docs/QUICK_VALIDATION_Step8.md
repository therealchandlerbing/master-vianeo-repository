## QUICK DECISION MATRIX

| Checks Passed | Decision |
|--------------|----------|
| 29/29 (100%) | ✅ **APPROVED** - Deliver immediately |
| 25-28 (86-97%) | ⚠️ **FIX MINOR** - Quick corrections needed |
| 21-24 (72-83%) | ❌ **REVISE** - Significant issues, rework required |
| <21 (<72%) | 🛑 **REJECT** - Does not meet minimum standards |

---

## FASTEST CHECKS (Do These First)

**30-second scan:**
1. Count players → should be 8-15
2. Count influencers → should be 3-8
3. Check acceptability → at least one "Unfavorable" or "[validate]" tag (realistic)

**If any fail → Stop and fix before full review**

---

## INSTANT RED FLAGS

**Stop immediately if you see:**
- ❌ All players rated "Favorable" (unrealistic)
- ❌ Generic categories instead of names ("suppliers" instead of "Acme Corp")
- ❌ No competitors identified
- ❌ Missing acceptability ratings
- ❌ No validation tags anywhere (unrealistic)
- ❌ Players and influencers confused (influencers don't transact)

---

## COMMON FIXES (2-minute corrections)

**All Favorable ratings?**
- Review competitors → they're likely Unfavorable or Neutral
- Check regulators → often Neutral until engaged
- Add "[validate]" for unconfirmed assumptions

**Generic categories only?**
- ❌ "Distribution partners"
- ✅ "Amazon Marketplace, Shopify App Store, Direct Sales Team"
- Research specific names in the industry

**Players vs Influencers confused?**
| Type | Relationship | Examples |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Player** | Transacts with you | Suppliers, channels, customers |
| **Influencer** | Shapes decisions but doesn't transact | Regulators, analysts, associations |

**Missing competitors?**
- Include direct competitors (same solution)
- Include indirect competitors (different solution, same need)
- Include "Do Nothing" as a competitor

| **Neutral** | No strong position, persuadable | Yellow (#f59e0b) |
