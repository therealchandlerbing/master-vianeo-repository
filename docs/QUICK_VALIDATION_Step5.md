## QUICK DECISION MATRIX

| Checks Passed | Decision |
|--------------|----------|
| 28/28 (100%) | ✅ **APPROVED** - Deliver immediately |
| 25-27 (89-96%) | ⚠️ **FIX MINOR** - Quick corrections needed |
| 22-24 (79-86%) | ❌ **REVISE** - Significant issues, rework required |
| <22 (<79%) | 🛑 **REJECT** - Does not meet minimum standards |

---

## FASTEST CHECKS (Do These First)

**30-second scan:**
1. Count needs → must be exactly 10
2. Check longest need → must be ≤60 characters
3. Count requesters → must be 6-10

**If any fail → Stop and fix before full review**

---

## INSTANT RED FLAGS

**Stop immediately if you see:**
- ❌ ANY need >60 characters
- ❌ Only 5 requesters or 12+ requesters
- ❌ "More than 5 interviewed" for ALL requesters (likely fabricated)
- ❌ No "[validate]" tags anywhere (unrealistic)
- ❌ Solution embedded in need: "Need AI-powered analytics dashboard"
- ❌ Missing "Doing Nothing" competitor

---

## COMMON FIXES (2-minute corrections)

**Need >60 characters?**

Shortening techniques:
- Remove filler: "very", "really", "that", "which"
- Use "&" instead of "and"
- Use "/" instead of "or"
- Remove articles: "the", "a", "an"
- Abbreviate: "%" not "percent", "#" not "number"
- Active voice: "Reduce time" not "Time needs to be reduced"

**Example:**
- ❌ (78 chars) "Students need to be able to track their learning progress over time easily"
- ✅ (57 chars) "Track learning progress over time w/ minimal effort"

**Overlapping needs?**
- Test: Could both needs be met by same feature?
- If YES → Merge or make more distinct
- Each need should address different aspect

**Solution in need statement?**
- ❌ "Need mobile app for scheduling"
- ✅ "Schedule appointments quickly from anywhere"
- Test: Remove technology/product → still a need?

**Missing "Doing Nothing"?**
- Always include as Existing Solution #1
- Description: "Status quo - no dedicated tool, manual process"
- Limitations: Why current approach fails

---

## THE 60-CHARACTER RULE

**Why it matters:**
- Forces clarity and specificity
- Prevents run-on vague statements
- Enables visual matrix display
- Professional presentation standard

**Character counting:**
- Includes spaces and punctuation
- Use character counter tool
- 60 chars ≈ 8-10 words ≈ 1 short sentence

**Examples at exactly 60 characters:**
```
"Track student performance across subjects over full year"  (59)
"Reduce time spent on admin tasks by 50%+ without errors"  (60)
"Access learning resources offline w/ automatic sync later" (60)
```

## RELIABILITY RATING PHRASES (Exact)

**Must use these EXACT phrases:**

| Phrase | Meaning | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| "More than 5 interviewed" | Validated | 6+ interviews conducted |
| "Less than 5 interviewed [validate]" | Partial | 1-4 interviews, needs more |
| "Not yet interviewed [validate]" | Hypothesis | 0 interviews, assumption |
| "Unspecified [validate]" | Generic role | Not specific enough |

**Do NOT use:**
- "Interviewed" (how many?)
- "Validated" (vague)
- "Research needed" (wrong format)
- Custom phrases

---

## NEEDS CATEGORIZATION

**Tasks (Jobs to be done):**
- What users are trying to accomplish
- Productive outcomes they seek
- Example: "Create weekly lesson plans in under 2 hours"

**Pains (Problems to eliminate):**
- Frustrations, obstacles, inefficiencies
- What slows them down or creates errors
- Example: "Eliminate duplicate data entry across 3 systems"

**Expectations (Desired outcomes):**
- Quality standards, reliability requirements
- How they want to feel during/after
- Example: "Receive instant feedback on quiz performance"

**Distribution:** Aim for roughly 4 tasks, 4 pains, 2 expectations
