## QUICK DECISION MATRIX

| Checks Passed | Decision |
|--------------|----------|
| 27/27 (100%) | ✅ **APPROVED** - Deliver immediately |
| 24-26 (89-96%) | ⚠️ **FIX MINOR** - Quick corrections needed |
| 20-23 (74-85%) | ❌ **REVISE** - Significant issues, rework required |

## FASTEST CHECKS (Do These First)

**30-second scan:**
1. Character count B7 (should be notably shorter at 200)
2. B2 contains no product/solution words
3. All bullet points have numbers (not vague claims)

**If any fail → Stop and fix before full review**

---

## COMMON FIXES (2-minute corrections)

**Over character limit?**
- Remove filler words: "very", "really", "actually", "basically"
- Use symbols: "&" instead of "and", "%" instead of "percent"
- Remove redundant phrases

**Solution in problem (B2)?**
- Rewrite from user perspective: pain felt, not solution offered
- Test: Remove your company name - problem still exists?

**Vague claims?**
- Replace "many" → actual number
- Replace "significant" → percentage/amount
- Replace "growing" → specific growth rate
