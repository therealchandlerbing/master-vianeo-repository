## QUICK DECISION MATRIX

| Checks Passed | Decision |
|--------------|----------|
| 35/35 (100%) | ✅ **APPROVED** - Deliver immediately |
| 30-34 (86-97%) | ⚠️ **FIX MINOR** - Quick corrections needed |
| 25-29 (71-83%) | ❌ **REVISE** - Significant issues, rework required |
| <25 (<71%) | 🛑 **REJECT** - Does not meet minimum standards |

---

## FASTEST CHECKS (Do These First)

**30-second scan:**
1. Unit economics → LTV:CAC ratio present and ≥3:1 (or explained if lower)
2. Business Model Canvas → All 9 boxes filled
3. Revenue projections → 3 years minimum with assumptions

**If any fail → Stop and fix before full review**

---

## INSTANT RED FLAGS

**Stop immediately if you see:**
- ❌ No unit economics calculated
- ❌ LTV:CAC ratio <1:1 without explanation
- ❌ "Hockey stick" revenue without justification
- ❌ Missing cost structure
- ❌ No break-even timeline
- ❌ Business Model Canvas incomplete
- ❌ Assumptions not documented
- ❌ Projections without basis in evidence

---

## COMMON FIXES (2-minute corrections)

**Missing unit economics?**
Calculate these minimums:
- CAC = Total acquisition cost / New customers
- LTV = Average revenue per customer × Customer lifetime
- LTV:CAC = LTV / CAC (target ≥3:1)
- Payback = CAC / Monthly revenue per customer

**LTV:CAC ratio too low?**
- Document path to improvement
- Identify specific levers (reduce CAC, increase LTV)
- Note if early-stage with expected improvement

**Revenue projections unrealistic?**
- Base on bottom-up calculation
- Customer count × Price × Conversion rate
- Document growth rate assumptions
- Compare to industry benchmarks

**Missing assumptions?**
List assumptions for:
- Customer acquisition rate
- Pricing stability
- Churn rate
- Cost growth
- Market conditions

## UNIT ECONOMICS BENCHMARKS

| Metric | Healthy | Concerning | Critical |
|--------|---------|------------|----------|

| **Gross Margin** | >70% (SaaS) | 50-70% | <50% |
| **Churn (Monthly)** | <2% | 2-5% | >5% |

## INTEGRATION WITH VIANEO DIMENSIONS

**Viability assessment synthesizes:**
- **Legitimacy (Step 4)**: Problem worth solving economically?
- **Desirability (Step 5-7)**: Enough customers willing to pay?
- **Acceptability (Step 8-9)**: Ecosystem supports business model?
- **Feasibility (Step 4, 10)**: Team can execute the model?

**Viability score requires:**
- Sustainable unit economics (LTV:CAC ≥3:1)
- Realistic path to profitability
- Manageable risk profile
- Adequate funding/runway
