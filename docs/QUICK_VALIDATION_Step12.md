## QUICK DECISION MATRIX

| Checks Passed | Decision |
|--------------|----------|
| 39/39 (100%) | **APPROVED** - Deliver immediately |
| 35-38 (90-97%) | **FIX MINOR** - Quick corrections needed |
| 30-34 (77-87%) | **REVISE** - Significant issues, rework required |
| <30 (<77%) | **REJECT** - Does not meet minimum standards |

---

## FASTEST CHECKS (Do These First)

**30-second scan:**
1. **MVP Features** → 6-10 per product (not more, not fewer)
2. **Fundamental Coverage** → 100% of fundamental needs have MVP features
3. **Platform Inputs** → All 4 business model summaries within 250 chars
4. **Coherence** → No red flags in alignment checks

**If any fail → Stop and fix before full review**

---

## INSTANT RED FLAGS

**Stop immediately if you see:**
- MVP feature count outside 6-10 range
- Fundamental needs without feature coverage
- Platform inputs over 250 characters
- "TBD" or vague pricing in Revenue Stream
- Missing coherence validation
- Features not mapped to validated needs
- Requesters not traced to Step 6 personas
- Needs not traced to Step 7 matrix

---

## COMMON FIXES (2-minute corrections)

**MVP features outside range?**
- Too many: Combine related features or defer to phased
- Too few: Review Step 11 for additional validated capabilities

**Fundamental needs uncovered?**
- Identify missing features from Step 11
- Or justify why need cannot be addressed in MVP

**Platform inputs over limit?**
- Condense without losing specificity
- Remove redundant words
- Focus on differentiating elements

**Coherence issues?**
- Identify misaligned component pair
- Adjust one component to align
- Document if intentional trade-off

## VALIDATION BENCHMARKS

### PMF Sheet Quality

| Metric | Target | Concerning | Critical |
|--------|--------|------------|----------|
| **MVP Features** | 6-10 | 5 or 11-12 | <5 or >12 |
| **Fundamental Coverage** | 100% | 80-99% | <80% |
| **High Validation (>5)** | >50% MVP | 30-50% MVP | <30% MVP |
| **Requesters** | 2-4 | 1 or 5 | 0 or >5 |

### Business Model Quality

| Metric | Target | Concerning | Critical |
|--------|--------|------------|----------|
| **Platform Inputs** | All 4 complete | 3 complete | <3 complete |
| **Character Compliance** | All within 250 | 1 over limit | Multiple over |
| **Coherence Checks** | All pass | 1-2 minor gaps | 3+ gaps |
| **Pricing Specificity** | Concrete examples | Ranges only | "TBD" |

---

## COHERENCE VALIDATION QUICK CHECK

**For each check, verify alignment:**

| Check | Question | Pass If |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Value-Features | Can MVP deliver value claims? | All advantages map to features |
| Value-Revenue | Does pricing reflect value? | Premium value = premium price |
| Revenue-Distribution | Does channel match complexity? | High-touch for complex, self-serve for simple |
| Distribution-Costs | Are CAC costs included? | Marketing/sales costs cover chosen channels |
| Costs-Revenue | Can revenue support costs? | Path to positive margin exists |

---

## COMMON RED FLAG COMBINATIONS

**Immediate concern if you see:**

| Red Flag Combination | Issue |
|---------------------|-------|
| Premium value + low price | Underpriced |
| Self-serve channel + enterprise product | Mismatched distribution |
| High CAC channels + no marketing costs | Incomplete cost structure |
| Complex product + no support costs | Missing operational costs |
| Recurring revenue + no churn assumption | Unrealistic projections |
