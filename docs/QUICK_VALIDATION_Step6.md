## QUICK DECISION MATRIX

| Checks Passed | Decision |
|--------------|----------|
| 32/32 (100%) | ✅ **APPROVED** - Deliver immediately |
| 28-31 (87-97%) | ⚠️ **FIX MINOR** - Quick corrections needed |
| 24-27 (75-84%) | ❌ **REVISE** - Significant issues, rework required |
| <24 (<75%) | 🛑 **REJECT** - Does not meet minimum standards |

---

## FASTEST CHECKS (Do These First)

**30-second scan:**
1. Count personas → must be 3-5
2. Check longest bullet → must be ≤60 characters
3. Check validation badges → must match interview counts

**If any fail → Stop and fix before full review**

---

## INSTANT RED FLAGS

**Stop immediately if you see:**
- ❌ ANY bullet >60 characters
- ❌ Age range instead of specific number ("35-45" instead of "42")
- ❌ All personas ✓ VALIDATED with no interviews conducted
- ❌ Full names instead of first names only
- ❌ Solution embedded: "Needs our AI dashboard"
- ❌ Generic personas: "Marketing Professional, 25-45"
- ❌ Current solutions = "various tools" (must be specific)
- ❌ Overlapping personas (same needs, different titles)

---

## COMMON FIXES (2-minute corrections)

**Bullet >60 characters?**
Shortening techniques:
- Remove adjectives: "very", "really", "extremely"
- Use numbers: "15 hours" not "significant time"
- Use symbols: "&" not "and", "/" not "or"
- Abbreviate: "%" not "percent", "#" not "number"
- Remove articles: "the", "a", "an"

**Example:**
- ❌ (72 chars) "Reduce the amount of time spent on manual administrative tasks daily"
- ✅ (54 chars) "Reduce time on manual admin tasks by 50%+ daily"

**Age is a range?**
- ❌ "35-45 years old"
- ✅ "42" (pick representative age)

**Overlapping personas?**
- Test: Would both buy the same product for same reason?
- If YES → Merge or find what makes them distinct
- Focus on behavioral differences, not just titles

**Current solutions vague?**
- ❌ "Uses spreadsheets and various tools"
- ✅ "Uses Excel ($0/mo) with manual data entry, Slack ($12/user/mo) for team updates"

## VALIDATION BADGE REFERENCE

| Status | Interview Count | Color |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| ✓ VALIDATED | 5+ interviews | Green (#E8F4EA / #2D7A3E) |
| ⚠ PARTIALLY VALIDATED | 1-4 interviews | Orange (#FFF4E6 / #CC7A00) |
| ✗ NEEDS VALIDATION | 0 interviews | Red (#FFEBEE / #C62828) |

**Honest Assessment:**
- Don't mark VALIDATED without evidence
- Use NEEDS VALIDATION when true
- Document gaps openly

---

## ACTIVITIES & CHALLENGES DISTRIBUTION

**Target distribution for 10 total bullets:**
- Tasks (Jobs to be done): 4 bullets
- Pains (Problems to eliminate): 4 bullets
- Expectations (Desired outcomes): 2 bullets

**Each category needs 4-6 bullets.**

---

## PERSONA DISTINCTNESS TEST

For each pair of personas, verify at least 2 of these differ:
- [ ] Primary pain point
- [ ] Key task/job to be done
- [ ] Decision-making authority
- [ ] Current solution set
- [ ] Budget/constraints
- [ ] Industry/company size

**If personas are too similar → Merge or differentiate further**

---
