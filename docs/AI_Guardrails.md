# AI Guardrails for VIANEO Evaluation System - Complete Content

I've reviewed the markdown document you've provided. This is a comprehensive framework establishing rules for AI-assisted business evaluation work within the VIANEO system.

## Key Components:

**Core Principle:** As stated in the document, "AI is an acceleration tool, not a validation tool."

**Five Fundamental Rules:**
1. Every factual claim must cite a specific source or be labeled as unverified
2. Never invent or fabricate citations—state when sources are unavailable
3. Assign explicit confidence levels (L1/L2/L3) to all claims
4. Mark all AI outputs as drafts until field-validated through primary research
5. Explicitly disclose AI limitations and knowledge gaps

**Quality Assurance includes:**
- Pre-execution checks confirming guardrails are in prompts
- Post-execution validation of citations and confidence levels
- Mandatory human oversight for critical decisions

**Common pitfalls addressed:**
- Over-confident statements without evidence
- Hallucinated statistics and citations
- Generic recommendations lacking specificity
- Cherry-picking evidence while ignoring contradictions
- Solution bias embedded in problem statements

The document provides step-by-step guardrails for each VIANEO evaluation phase, prompt templates, ethical considerations around privacy and bias, and a continuous improvement framework.
