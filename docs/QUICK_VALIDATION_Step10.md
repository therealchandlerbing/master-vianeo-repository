## FASTEST CHECKS (Do These First)

**30-second scan:**
1. Count sentences in Executive Diagnostic → must be 6-8
2. Search for em dash "—" → must be zero occurrences
3. Check actions → all must have owner in parentheses

**If any fail → Stop and fix before full review**

---

## INSTANT RED FLAGS

**Stop immediately if you see:**
- ❌ Executive Diagnostic has 10+ sentences (too long)
- ❌ Executive Diagnostic has <6 sentences (too short)
- ❌ Em dashes (—) present anywhere
- ❌ Actions without owners
- ❌ Vague language ("some concerns", "needs work")
- ❌ Generic statements ("team seems capable")

---

## COMMON FIXES (2-minute corrections)

**Too many sentences (9+)?**
- Combine related ideas with commas
- Remove redundant statements
- Each sentence must add NEW information

**Missing owners?**
- Add after action: "(Owner Name)"
- Format: "Shawna should [action] (Shawna)"
- Or: "Leadership team must [action] (Shawna, Soufiane)"

**Em dashes present?**
- Replace "—" with ", " (comma + space)
- Or use parentheses: (like this)
- Never use em dashes in VIANEO outputs

**Vague language?**
- Replace "many" → actual number
- Replace "some concerns" → specific vulnerability
- Replace "needs work" → "scored 1.8, requires X"
- Replace "could" → "must" or "should"

**Generic statements?**
- Add specifics: "50+ beta users", "zero revenue"
- Add names: "Shawna", not "the founder"
- Add numbers: "$20-50 ARPU", not "pricing model"

## SENTENCE COUNT TRICK

**Executive Diagnostic Quick Count:**
1. Count periods (.) in the 4 paragraphs
2. Typical distribution:
   - Para 1 (Strengths): 1-2 periods
   - Para 2 (Risks): 1-2 periods
   - Para 3 (Actions): 2-3 periods
   - Para 4 (Evidence): 1-2 periods
   - **Total**: 6-8 periods = 6-8 sentences

**If count is off:**
- Too high (9+): Combine sentences, remove fluff
- Too low (<6): Split complex sentences, add specifics
