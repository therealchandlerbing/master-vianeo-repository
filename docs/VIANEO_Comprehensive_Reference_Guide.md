## Framework Overview

### Purpose

The VIANEO framework provides a **rigorous, evidence-based methodology** for evaluating whether a startup or innovation project is viable, desirable, and feasible. Outputs are designed to be **committee-ready and investor-presentable**.

### Core Philosophy

> "AI is an acceleration tool, not a validation tool."

Every claim must be supported by evidence. Every score must reflect documented validation. Every recommendation must be actionable and specific.

### Key Principles

1. **Evidence over opinion**: Only documented validation supports high scores
2. **Specificity over generality**: Name names, cite numbers, reference sources
3. **Conservative scoring**: When uncertain, score lower
4. **Organizations don't have needs—people do**: Identify specific requesters
5. **Problem statements describe challenges, not prescribe solutions**

## The 5 VIANEO Dimensions

### Dimension Overview

| Dimension | Weight | Threshold | Core Question |
|-----------|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **Legitimacy** | 15% | ≥3.0 | Is there a real, validated problem worth solving? |
| **Desirability** | 25% | **≥3.5** | Do specific people want YOUR solution? (HIGHEST BAR) |
| **Acceptability** | 20% | ≥3.0 | Will the ecosystem support you? |
| **Feasibility** | 20% | ≥3.0 | Can you actually build and deliver it? |
| **Viability** | 20% | ≥3.0 | Is the business model economically sustainable? |

### Decision Threshold

**GO Decision Requires:**
- Overall weighted score ≥3.2

## Scoring System

### The 1-5 Scale

| Score | Label | Evidence Level | Description |
|-------|-------|----------------|-------------|
| **1** | Very Weak | None | No evidence, pure assumption |
| **2** | Weak | L1 - Internal | Team statements only |
| **3** | Adequate | L2 - Partial | Some external validation |
| **4** | Good | L3 - Validated | Strong external evidence |
| **5** | Excellent | L3+ - Multiple | Multiple validated sources |

### Confidence Levels

| Level | Label | Evidence Type | Score Supported |
|-------|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| **L1** | Internal Only | Team beliefs, internal research | 1-2 only |
| **L2** | Partially Validated | Limited interviews, secondary research | 2-3 |
| **L3** | Externally Validated | 5+ interviews, market data, expert validation | 4-5 |

### Evidence Requirements by Score

**Score 4-5 Requires:**
- Documented interviews with names/dates
- User testing with specific feedback
- Named expert validation
- Cited market research
- Signed agreements/MOUs (where applicable)
- Actual usage data

**Score 1-2 Indicates:**
- "Team believes"
- Internal opinions only
- Assumptions without validation
- Plans (not executed)

## Evidence Requirements

### Interview Thresholds

| Interview Count | Validation Status | Score Supported |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 0 | Needs Validation | 1 |
| 1-2 | Minimal | 2 |
| 3-4 | Partial | 2-3 |
| 5-9 | Validated | 3-4 |
| 10+ | Strongly Validated | 4-5 |

### Evidence Types

| Type | Examples | Strength |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Primary** | Direct interviews, user tests, experiments | Strongest |
| **Secondary** | Market reports, competitor analysis, expert opinions | Moderate |
| **Internal** | Team experience, assumptions, plans | Weakest |

### Documentation Requirements

Every claim must include:
1. **Source**: Where did this come from?
2. **Date**: When was it gathered?
3. **Method**: How was it collected?
4. **Confidence**: L1/L2/L3 rating

## Character Limits & Platform Requirements

### Critical Limits (Strictly Enforced)

| Field | Character Limit | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Need statements | **60 chars** | Tasks, Pains, Expectations |
| Problem statement | 250 chars | Solution-neutral |
| Field of application | 250 chars | Industry/context |
| Means descriptions | 60 chars | Human, Physical, Financial |
| Persona bullets | 60 chars | All Activities & Challenges |

### Shortening Strategies

When over limit:
1. Remove adjectives: "very", "really", "extremely"
2. Use symbols: "&" not "and", "/" not "or", "%" not "percent"
3. Use numbers: "15 hours" not "significant time"
4. Abbreviate: "RFPs" not "requests for proposals"
5. Remove articles: "the", "a", "an"
6. Front-load key information

**Example:**
- ❌ (78 chars) "Students need to be able to track their learning progress over time easily"
- ✅ (57 chars) "Track learning progress over time w/ minimal effort"

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Solution Embedded in Problem
**Wrong**: "Healthcare providers need our scheduling software"
**Right**: "Healthcare providers spend 12+ hours/week on manual scheduling"

### 2. Generic Personas
**Wrong**: "Marketing Professional, 25-45 years old"
**Right**: "Sarah, 42, Director of Marketing at B2B SaaS company, 15 years experience"

### 3. Optimistic Scoring Bias
**Wrong**: Score 4 based on "team is confident"
**Right**: Score 2 with note "requires 5+ customer interviews to validate"

### 4. Overlapping Needs
**Test**: Could both needs be met by same feature?
**If Yes**: Merge or make more distinct

### 5. Missing "Do Nothing" Competitor
**Always include**: Status quo is a competitor

### 6. Vague Validation
**Wrong**: "Validated with customers"
**Right**: "Validated with 8 customers (3 enterprise, 5 SMB) in Oct-Nov 2024"
