# Vianeo Business Validation Framework: Complete Reference

This comprehensive guide consolidates resources for conducting business validation sprints using the Vianeo platform, last updated November 2025.

## Core Components

The document includes:

1. **40-Question Diagnostic Scan** — Evaluates project maturity across five dimensions: team capability, technology readiness, business management, market knowledge, and commercial traction.

2. **29-Question Market Maturity Assessment** — Assesses readiness using the Vianeo framework's five dimensions: Legitimacy, Desirability, Acceptability, Feasibility, and Viability.

3. **Platform Character Limits** — Strict specifications for content submission, ranging from 60 characters (fields like "Financial Means") to 250 characters (Problem Statements, Differentiating Advantages).

4. **Sprint Execution Guide** — Addresses common pitfalls including embedding solutions in problem statements, optimistic scoring bias, vague personas, and overlapping needs.

5. **Needs Qualification Matrix** — A tool for systematically evaluating importance and satisfaction levels across requester segments.

## Key Guidance

The framework emphasizes that "problem statements should describe challenges, not prescribe solutions" and recommends using "How might we..." formatting. Scoring requires documented evidence, with reliability ratings based on interview sample sizes and validation depth.

The guide stresses strict adherence to character limits with no exceptions and provides emergency editing strategies for overages.
