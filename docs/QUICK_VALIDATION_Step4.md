# Quick Validation Guide: Step 4 - Legitimacy Worksheet

**Purpose**: Fast 5-minute quality check before delivery
**Pass Criteria**: All ✓ boxes must be checked
**Dimension**: Legitimacy (15% of VIANEO score)

---

## 1. STRUCTURE (5 items)

- [ ] Header with all required metadata fields
- [ ] Problem statement section complete
- [ ] Field of application defined
- [ ] Means analysis (Human, Physical/Intellectual, Financial)
- [ ] Differentiation assessment included

## 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT (6 items - CRITICAL)

- [ ] Problem described without mentioning solution
- [ ] Specific population affected with size estimates
- [ ] Quantified impact (time, cost, frequency)
- [ ] Current inadequacies documented
- [ ] Uses "How might we..." format where appropriate
- [ ] ≤250 characters for platform fields

## 3. FIELD OF APPLICATION (5 items)

- [ ] Industry/sector clearly defined
- [ ] Geographic scope specified
- [ ] Customer segment identified
- [ ] Use case context provided
- [ ] No solution embedded in field description

## 4. MEANS ANALYSIS (6 items)

**Human Means:**
- [ ] Team capabilities listed with specificity
- [ ] Each means marked as Differentiating: Yes/No

**Physical/Intellectual Means:**
- [ ] Technology, IP, assets identified
- [ ] Each means marked as Differentiating: Yes/No

**Financial Means:**
- [ ] Current funding status documented
- [ ] Each means marked as Differentiating: Yes/No

## 5. DIFFERENTIATION (4 items)

- [ ] At least 1-2 differentiating means identified
- [ ] Differentiation is genuine (not table stakes)
- [ ] Differentiation validated (not assumed)
- [ ] Non-differentiating means acknowledged

## 6. EVIDENCE QUALITY (4 items)

- [ ] Problem validated externally (not just team belief)
- [ ] Validation sources cited
- [ ] Confidence levels assigned (L1/L2/L3)
- [ ] Gaps clearly documented

## QUICK DECISION MATRIX

| Checks Passed | Decision |
|--------------|----------|
| 30/30 (100%) | ✅ **APPROVED** - Deliver immediately |
| 26-29 (87-97%) | ⚠️ **FIX MINOR** - Quick corrections needed |
| 22-25 (73-87%) | ❌ **REVISE** - Significant issues, rework required |
| <22 (<73%) | 🛑 **REJECT** - Does not meet minimum standards |

---

## FASTEST CHECKS (Do These First)

**30-second scan:**
1. Problem statement → Must be solution-neutral
2. Check means → At least 1 marked "Differentiating: Yes"
3. Validation → External sources cited

**If any fail → Stop and fix before full review**

---

## INSTANT RED FLAGS

**Stop immediately if you see:**
- ❌ Solution embedded in problem: "Need our AI platform to..."
- ❌ No differentiating means identified
- ❌ All validation is internal ("team believes")
- ❌ Problem is vague: "inefficient processes"
- ❌ Missing quantification of problem impact
- ❌ Field of application = solution description

---

## COMMON FIXES (2-minute corrections)

**Solution in problem statement?**
- ❌ "Healthcare providers need our scheduling software"
- ✅ "Healthcare providers spend 12+ hours/week on manual scheduling"
- Test: Remove your product → still a valid problem?

**No differentiating means?**
- Review team backgrounds for unique expertise
- Check IP/technology for novel elements
- Look for exclusive partnerships or access

**Validation only internal?**
- Add "[L1 - requires external validation]" label
- Identify specific interviews or research needed
- Don't claim validation that doesn't exist

**Problem too vague?**
- Add specific numbers (time, cost, frequency)
- Name specific affected population
- Cite source of problem data

## CHARACTER LIMITS

| Field | Limit | Platform Requirement |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| Problem Statement | 250 chars | Vianeo platform |
| Field of Application | 250 chars | Vianeo platform |
| Means descriptions | 60 chars each | Matrix display |
| Differentiation notes | 100 chars | Supporting detail |

---

## MEANS FORMAT REQUIREMENT

**Exact format for each means:**
```
[Description] | Differentiating: Yes/No
```

**Examples:**
- ✅ "30+ years sales relationships in manufacturing | Differentiating: Yes"
- ✅ "React/Node.js development capability | Differentiating: No"
- ❌ "Strong team with relevant experience" (too vague)

## LEGITIMACY SCORING GUIDE

| Score | Evidence Required | Example |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| 5 | 10+ external interviews confirming problem | "Interviewed 15 clinic managers, all confirmed scheduling pain" |
| 4 | 5-9 external validations | "6 stakeholder interviews plus industry report" |
| 3 | 3-4 external data points | "3 interviews + market research citation" |
| 2 | 1-2 data points or internal only | "2 interviews conducted" |
| 1 | No validation | "Team believes based on experience" |

## OUTPUT FILES CHECKLIST

**Must deliver:**
- [ ] Markdown analysis document
- [ ] DOCX professional format (if required)

**Downstream dependencies:**
- Step 11 (Means View) uses means with differentiation status

**Time Budget**: 5 minutes maximum for this validation
**Related Doc**: `docs/FORMAT_SPEC_Step4_Legitimacy.md` (if created)

**Threshold**: Legitimacy score ≥3.0 required
