# Project Overview (3 paragraphs)
project_overview:
  - "The IRDose project represents a technically sophisticated venture developing a personalized radioiodine dosimetry system for hyperthyroidism treatment. Over four validation sessions spanning October through December 2025, 360 Social Impact Studios conducted a comprehensive Vianeo business model evaluation covering all five critical dimensions: Legitimacy, Desirability, Acceptability, Feasibility, and Viability."

  - "The project demonstrates exceptional technical legitimacy with a validated clinical problem (20-29% treatment failure rates in current fixed-dose I-131 therapy), a functional TRL 4-5 laboratory prototype featuring GAGG+SiPM crystal spectrometry achieving 7-12% energy resolution, and a world-class team of 13+ doctorate-level researchers at IPEN/CNEN. Secured FAPESP PIPE funding of R$600,000, established partnerships at HC/FMUSP for clinical validation, and operational IRDose cloud platform with INPI intellectual property registration provide strong institutional backing."

  - "However, the market maturity score of 3.1/5.0 falls below the 3.2 threshold for commercial readiness, driven primarily by critical gaps in customer validation and business model development rather than technical limitations. The project's path to commercial success requires immediate execution of a comprehensive customer discovery sprint before advancing to Series A fundraising."

# Primary Recommendation
primary_recommendation_status: "CONDITIONAL PROCEED with mandatory customer discovery sprint"

primary_recommendation_summary: "The IRDose project demonstrates sufficient technical legitimacy and platform readiness to warrant continued development. However, advancement to Series A fundraising or scaled clinical deployment requires immediate execution of a comprehensive customer discovery sprint to validate fundamental business model assumptions."

validation_gaps:
  - "Zero customer discovery interviews conducted despite clear technical capabilities"
  - "Pricing assumptions ($400-800/month) untested against SUS budget constraints"
  - "Patient wearability acceptance and physician trust in IoT sensor data unvalidated"
  - "Gaugit manufacturing partnership remains informal"
  - "100% grant-dependent funding structure with no commercial team members"

immediate_next_steps:
  - "Execute 40-60 structured customer discovery interviews across all stakeholder segments"
  - "Recruit commercial co-founder or advisor with Brazilian medtech market experience"
  - "Formalize Gaugit manufacturing partnership with capacity commitments and pricing tiers"
  - "Restructure financial model to validate SUS reimbursement pathways and pricing acceptance"
  - "Initiate HC/FMUSP pilot study with 10-patient clinical validation"

    strategy: "Champion strategy with HC/FMUSP early adopters. Publish clinical validation results in peer-reviewed journals. Provide comprehensive training and support."

  - risk: "ANVISA certification delays"
    impact: "Medium"
    strategy: "Early consultant engagement. Parallel preparation during pilot study. Budget 18-24 months for certification process."

  - risk: "Gaugit partnership breakdown"
    impact: "High"
    strategy: "Formalize agreement immediately. Identify backup detector suppliers. Consider in-house manufacturing capability long-term."

  - risk: "Competitive entry during validation"
    impact: "Low"
    strategy: "Accelerate pilot timeline. Publish validation results quickly. Leverage IPEN institutional advantage and Brazil-first strategy."

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SECTION 6: CONCLUSION
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

conclusion:
  - "The IRDose personalized radioiodine dosimetry system represents a technically exceptional venture with world-class capabilities, validated clinical problem, and strong institutional backing. The Vianeo evaluation reveals an overall platform readiness score of 4.1/5.0, demonstrating sufficient maturity for continued development with strategic de-risking."

  - "However, the market maturity score of 3.1/5.0 falls below the 3.2 threshold for commercial readiness. This gap stems not from technical deficiencies, but from critical validation gaps in customer discovery, business model testing, and commercial structure development. The project currently exhibits the classic pattern of exceptional research foundations without parallel commercial validation."

  - "The path forward is clear: Execute immediate customer discovery sprint to validate fundamental assumptions about pricing, wearability acceptance, and workflow integration. Recruit commercial expertise to complement technical depth. Formalize critical partnerships (Gaugit, ANVISA consultation) before advancing to scaled deployment or Series A fundraising."

  - "The assessment recommends CONDITIONAL PROCEED with mandatory 90-day validation sprint. Upon successful completion of customer discovery and business model validation, the project will be positioned for Series A readiness assessment and scaled clinical deployment across Brazil's nuclear medicine network."
