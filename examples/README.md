## Example Details

### Early Stage Example: HealthTech Scheduling Platform
**File**: `Example_Assessment_Early_Stage.md`

- **Stage**: Pre-Seed, Idea Validation
- **Overall Score**: 1.9 / 5.0
- **Status**: Non-viable - Validation Required
- **Key Finding**: Problem validated but zero customer discovery interviews conducted
- **Recommendation**: Pause development, complete customer discovery sprint

**Demonstrates**:
- How to score early-stage projects with limited validation
- Appropriate use of Score 1 (insufficient evidence)
- Identifying critical gaps and red flags
- Creating actionable next steps for validation

### Promising Stage Example: EduLearn AI Tutoring Platform
**File**: `Example_Assessment_Promising_Stage.md`

- **Stage**: Seed, Product-Market Fit Validation
- **Overall Score**: 4.1 / 5.0
- **Status**: Promising - Proceed with Confidence
- **Key Finding**: Excellent customer validation (54 interviews, 80% retention)
- **Recommendation**: Proceed with growth while strengthening partner network

**Demonstrates**:
- How to score validated projects with strong evidence
- Appropriate use of Score 4-5 (strong external validation)
- Identifying minor gaps in otherwise strong assessments
- Strategic recommendations for scaling

### Step 9 Example: TechEd Ecosystem Analysis
**Files**: `Step9_Example_TechEd_Analysis.md` + `TechEd_2025-01-15_08_Value_Network.html`

**Demonstrates**:
- Complete ecosystem value network mapping
- Interactive HTML visualization output
- Player and influencer positioning
- Value flow documentation
